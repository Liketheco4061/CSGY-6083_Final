# CSGY-6083_Final
CSGY-6083 Final Project

This project in a fictional law enforcement angency's internal investigations database. Note, all the SQL code is one file, however you can do a CTRL + F search to find code blocks for functions, triggers, views, etc (the code is also highlighted in the presentation) since comments show where the blocks start. The project is hosted on hostinger and can be accessed live below. I tried to make sure that pages did not cache, so the latest inputs would be present, but I'm new to php so there's a possibilty I missed something and you may need to refresh a page after an update. Slides, ER diagram and code are all attached. Pertinent links below. Good look with the rest of your semester/finals!
